            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <h4>FireEye</h4>
            <p>
                This summer, I will be completing a red team intern with the consulting company FireEye. There I will learn about professional penetration testing and red team practices. I will aid in conducting internal, external, and web application assessments. I hope to also get experience conducting social engineering engagements.

            <h4>Red Sky Alliance</h4>
            <img src=imgs/red.png class="red" alt="RedSky">
            <p>
                This semester, I held an internship with Red Sky Alliance as a cyber threat intelligence intern. There I conducted open source information gathering to develop actionable intelligence for businesses. I also worked to deliver verbal and written presentations on emerging cyber trends. Some of my daily tasks included scraping the dark web, writing triage reports for clients, and observing ransomware gangs.
            </p>
            <h4>BAE Systems</h4>
            <p>
                Prior to coming to UNH Manchester, I shadowed BAE Systems at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant. There I shadowed the research & development department to learn professional chemical engineering practices and procedures.

            <h4>Bug Bounty Hunting</h4>
            <p>
                For those who do not know, a bug bounty program is a deal offered by many websites, organizations and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to security exploits and vulnerabilities. It basically incentives and allows for freelance hacking of company's web assets. I am an avid bug bounty hunter with <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/cinzinga">Bugcrowd</a> and I am currently ranked in the top 85 all time hunters.
