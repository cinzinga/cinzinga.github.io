I am a current Information Technology student with a passion for cyber security topics. Independently I have pursued multiple professional certifications in the field. From these certifications I have demonstrated a proficiency in network reconnaissance, web exploitation, and privilege escalation among other topics. As an amateur security researcher and bug hunter, I have worked with companies to identify, exploit, and report vulnerabilities I discovered in their web applications.

Work in progress.
