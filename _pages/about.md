My name is Chris, I am a college student studying computer information systems. I am an aspiring information security professional specializing in offensive security.

## Education

I am currently in the last year of my B.S in Computer Information Systems from University of New Hampshire.

## Employment

I have worked as a cyber threat intelligence intern at a small local company. Most recently, I had the opportunity to work as a red team intern at a well-known consulting firm.

Additionally, I am an active bug bounty hunter with Synack Red Team and Bugcrowd (currently ranked in the all-time top 75).

## Home Life
In my free time I enjoy the outdoors, walking my dogs, and listening to audiobooks. I am also an avid Star Wars fan and enjoy brewing my own beer!
